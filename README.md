# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Monitoring-Dashboard

The Colombo Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard project was initiated to answer the 
increased need for monitoring air pollution in the Colombo metropolitan region. The dashboard 
offers real-time air quality monitoring of the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on simulated data 
from strategically positioned sensors around the city. The project aspires to create an open, 
accessible, and integrated platform to monitor air quality for the benefit of environmental 
authorities, researchers, and the general public.
